This is an extremely interesting text.
This is the result to he work  
and BStudent.

Meanwhile BStudent calls up AStudent. BStudent 
tells him he will improve this part of the text, 
he will do this on a different branch so that he 
will not interfere with AStudent?s work.
*PLACE HOLDER: BSTUDENT HAS A CRUCIAL IMPROVEMENT*

AStudent suddenly realises that there is a 
very nice text, that copes very nicely with 
what BStudent is about to write. This is why 
he is creating a new branch and writing 
his text here. 
*PLACE HOLDER: ASTUDENT'S TEXT*

Before merging the two branches, AStudent
writes a very nice conclusion for the document
and commits it.
*PLACE HOLDER: (ASTUDENT or BSTUDENT)'S TEXT*

I have made some modification as a Bstudent. thank you A student for your patients
